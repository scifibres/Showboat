## Components
- Fleur de lis sew-on ornaments:
	- Small (shoulders)
	- Large (skirt)
- Centre front panel of fleur de lis motifs on net

## How to print

### Hardware
- **Printer**: Prusa Original MK4
- **Filament**: Silk PLA, 1.75mm (gold)
- Small neodymium magnets

### Printing on fabric
How to:
- Design and slice as usual
- Add a breakpoint at ca 0.6mm. Mileage may vary, the goal is to have a full base layer but no (or minimal) infill yet.
- Start the print
- Cut the net to the desired shape and size
- When it pauses, place the net on top of the print. It should sit smooth but not stretched. Fix in place with the magnets
- If your printer is temperamental, you might have to manually recalibrate the Z axis at this point
- (If your printer has a glass bed, tape could work as well)
- Continue the print. Supervise it for a few minutes to make sure the net doesn't get pulled off the print by the nozzle
- Finish as usual
- When done, remove *gently* and clean up the print as usual

Do a sample first to see how your materals behave with this technique and adjust print settings as required.
